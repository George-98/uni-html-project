						The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb 
						(680 kg) for F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles. Air-to-surface weapons
						for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, 
						Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser).

						GBU-53/B SDB II, and the SPEAR 3 anti-tank missiles; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the 
						F-35A and F-35C, and three for F-35B.The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Two compartments
						behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, and towed decoys.
