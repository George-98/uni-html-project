				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p class="cardText">
					The F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation fighter, combining advanced stealth with fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information,
					network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. The Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft designed for many missions 
					with advanced, integrated sensors built into every aircraft. Missions that were traditionally performed by small numbers of specialized aircraft, 
					such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and electronic attack missions can now be executed by a squadron of F-35s, bringing new 
					capabilities to many allied forces. The F-35 has a wing-tail configuration with two vertical stabilizers canted for stealth. Flight control 
					surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons. To preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays with four weapons stations. 
					The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for F-35B, while the two inboard stations 
					carry air-to-air missiles. Air-to-surface weapons for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, 
					Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser). The station can also carry multiple smaller munitions such 
					as the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), GBU-53/B SDB II, and the SPEAR 3 anti-tank missiles; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the 
					F-35A and F-35C, and three for F-35B.The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM. Two compartments behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, 
					and towed decoys.
