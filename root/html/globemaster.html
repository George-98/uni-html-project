				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p class="cardText">
					The C-17 Globemaster III (Globemaster C-17) is a longrange, heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft that can operate close to a potential 
					area of operations for combat, peacekeeping or humanitarian missions worldwide. C-17 is capable of rapid, strategic delivery of troops and 
					all types of cargo to main operating bases anywhere in the world.  The Globemaster’s load-bearing rear ramp and digitally controlled loading 
					systems, combined with the skills of its crews and ground handlers, enable large, complex items of equipment, including Chinook helicopters, 
					military vehicles and other heavy items of specialist kit to be loaded. It can transport 100,000lb (45,360kg) of freight more than 4,500nm 
					(8,334km) while flying at altitudes above 35,000ft.  The aircraft’s design enables high-angle, steep approaches at relatively slow speeds,
					allowing it to operate into small, austere airfields and onto runways as short as 3,500ft long and just 90ft wide.
