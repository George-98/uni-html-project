				<h2>Facts</h2>
				<ul>
				  <li class="factListItems">
						The Avro Vulcan	is a jet-powered tailless delta wing high-altitude strategic bomber, which was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF).
				  </li>
				  <li class="factListItems">
						As a part of the RAF's V-Force, the aircraft was the key part of the UK’s airborne nuclear deterrent during much of the Cold War. 
						Although typically armed with nuclear weapons, the Vulcan’s ability to also carry conventional weapons was used to full effect on 
						Operation Black Buck during the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982 - This was to be the only mission 
						‘flown in anger’ by an Avro Vulcan.
				  </li>
				  <li class="factListItems">
						Carrying no defensive weaponry, the Vulcan relied upon high-speed high-altitude flight to evade interception and whilst electronic 
						countermeasures were employed by the B.1 (designated B.1A) and B.2 from circa 1960, the Vulcan was always vulnerable to air attack.
