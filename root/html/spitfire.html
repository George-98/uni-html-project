				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p class="cardText">
					The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied 
					countries before, during, and after World War II. Many variants of the Spitfire were built, using several wing 
					configurations, and it was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. During the Battle of Britain, from 
					July to October 1940, the public perceived the Spitfire to be the main RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hurricane 
					shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. However, Spitfire units had 
					a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of the Spitfire's higher 
					performance. During the battle, Spitfires were generally tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersâ€”mainly Messerschmitt Bf 
					109E-series aircraft, which were a close match for them.
