				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p class="cardText">
				The B-2 Spirit is a low-observable, strategic, long-range, heavy bomber capable of penetrating sophisticated and dense air-defence shields.
				Its distinctive profile comes from the unique ‘flying wing’ construction. The leading edges of the wings are angled at 33° and the trailing 
				edge has a double-W shape. It is manufactured at the Northrop Grumman facilities in Pico Rivera and Palmdale in California, US. Northrop 
				Grumman has developed a radar-absorbent coating to preserve the B-2’s stealth characteristics while drastically reducing maintenance time. 
				The new material, known as alternate high-frequency material (AHFM), is sprayed on by four independently controlled robots. The B-2 has a 
				number of design features to make it stealthy. The flying-wing shape itself is almost invisible to radar, a fact discovered with the YB-49. 
				Instead of aluminum, the B-2 is made from low-reflective carbon-fiber composites. A special coating further reduces radar reflectivity. 
				Placement of the engines on top dramatically cuts the plane's infra-red signature. The B-2 was even designed to inject special chemicals 
				into its exhaust to eliminate the telltale white contrail.
